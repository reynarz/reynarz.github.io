Dear Hiring Manager,
                <br><br>


I'm a passionate game developer with experience as a Lead Gameplay and Tools Programmer, and I’m always excited about the opportunity to contribute to creative, technically challenging projects.
                <br>
        <br>

In my previous roles, I’ve collaborated on character systems, enemy AI, user interfaces, and developed custom standalone tools as well as tools for the Unity3D editor. I’ve also worked on custom game engines, implementing rendering, animation, and physics systems, along with building the full editor interface. Beyond implementing features, I’ve focused on improving team workflows and optimizing performance, helping teams meet or beat deadlines while maintaining high code quality.
                <br>
        <br>

I’m always eager to grow as a developer and contribute meaningfully to any team I’m a part of. Whether it’s solving technical challenges, supporting artists and designers with efficient tools, or bringing gameplay to life, I love finding ways to push projects forward.
                <br><br>


If you're interested in working together, I’d be thrilled to connect. Let’s build something amazing.
                <br><br>

Sincerely,

<h4>
