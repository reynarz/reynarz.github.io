        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p>
            I'm a passionate, proactive, and quality-driven Unity3D game developer with experience as a <span class="highlight">Senior Lead Gameplay</span> and <span class="highlight">Tools Programmer</span>, and I’m always excited about the opportunity to contribute to creative, technically challenging projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my previous roles, I’ve collaborated on character systems, enemy AI, user interfaces, and developed custom standalone tools as well as tools for the Unity3D editor. I’ve also worked on custom game engines, implementing rendering, animation, and integrating physics systems, along with building the full editor GUI. Beyond implementing features, I’ve focused on <span class="highlight">improving team workflows</span> and optimizing performance, helping teams meet deadlines while maintaining high code quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m always eager to <span class="highlight">grow</span> as a developer and <span class="highlight">contribute meaningfully</span> to any team I’m a part of. Whether it’s solving technical challenges, supporting artists and designers with efficient tools, or bringing gameplay to life, I love finding ways to push projects forward.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        I love, truly love, working alongside artists and building tools that make their workflows smoother and more efficient. Seeing their reactions, the surprise, the excitement, after a tool improves their day-to-day work is one of the most rewarding parts of my job.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're interested in working together, I’d be thrilled to connect. <span class="highlight">Let’s build something amazing</span>.
        </p>

        <p class="signature">Sincerely,</p>
