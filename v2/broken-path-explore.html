                <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p>
                    Broken Path is an upcoming pixel art Metroidvania where you are a 
                    12-year old kid called Adriel who escaped from his parent's house to fight 
                    crazy bosses and save the world from the awakening of the machines.

                <h2>ABOUT THIS VERSION</h2>
                <p>
                This version was shown at Game Developer Day in the Dominican Republic and was created solely for showcasing purposes. This is a remaster made in four weeks! The real game will be heavily improved in every aspect: gameplay, art, animations, levels, story, audio, and more.

                <h2>DEVELOPMENT HISTORY</h2>
                <p>
                   In 2018, I created a demo with the code name “Irrt” for my portfolio, and I only recently started showing it to the public. A lot of people reacted with comments like, “Is this a game already?”, “Where can I see more?”, and “Please make this happen!!!” With such great feedback, it became very clear what I had to do: turn it into a full game with compelling gameplay and story.
