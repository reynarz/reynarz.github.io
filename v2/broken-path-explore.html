                <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
                <p>
                    Broken Path is an upcoming pixel art Metroidvania where you are a 
                    12-year old kid called Adriel who escaped from his parent's house to fight 
                    crazy bosses and save the world from the awakening of the machines.

                <h2>ABOUT THIS VERSION</h2>
                <p>
                    This version was shown at the Game Developer Day in the Dominican Republic. 
                    And was only for showcasing purposes, this is just a remaster made in 4 weeks. 
                    The real game will be very, very heavily improved in all senses: Gameplay, 
                    Art, Animations, Levels, Story, Audio and so.

                <h2>DEVELOPMENT HISTORY</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2018, I made a demo with the code name “Irrt” for the portfolio and 
                    I just started to show it to the public. A lot of people told me things like 
                    “Is this a game already?”, “Where can I see more?”, “Please make this happen!!!” 
                    And with that great feedback, it was very clear what I had to do… Make the game 
                    with great gameplay and story.
